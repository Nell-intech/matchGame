**MATCH**

**Game Logic**

Match is a game of matching two cars of the same type. 
The player clicks on the back of one card, card turns over and stays on the screen. 
The user clicks another card and if that card is a match, the matched cards are moved from the screen and the score increases.
If the cards do not match then both cards are flipped back over showing the back of the card. 
Useer  selects two cards again and try to math them.
Game is over once user clears the board
prompt reset
** Two player idea -> two boards, two scores. The user that completes game first, wins. **
