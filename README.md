## Known issues of the game

This proect is still ongoing. Below are a list of known issues that have not been completed yet. Also, is a list of what I hope to accomplish in the future.

#### The known issues: 

1. On page load there is an alert that says the end user has made a match
2. after a certain number of matches the sorry try again alert will not let you enter to clear it
3. When you click on a card that has already been matched, the image comes up

#### And for the future...:

1. The code can be a lot cleaner. I would love to work on refractoring the code by integrating OOP and OOCSS. I believe this will also help with the readability of the code and in turn, this will help fix bugs.
2. An improvment focus in the UI/UX Design for this project would be a nice challenge
3. Increase the levels
4. Making it a two player game to test speed of player 
5. Changing the for loop to a forEach to loop over array of cards and //do something
6. reset button
